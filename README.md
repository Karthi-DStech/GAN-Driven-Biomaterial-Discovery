# Welcome to [AI-based Advancements for Biomaterial Discovery: Comparative Analysis of GAN Models in Topography Generation]

## Hello and thank you for visiting the repository of [GANs-for-BIO-MATERIAL-DISCOVERY]! This project is dedicated to exploring the innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

<h3>This Repository includes detailed documentation, source code, and results from our research.</h3>


IN THIS READ ME FILE, USERS CAN FIND STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS AND FEEL FREE TO EXPLORE.

- In the **IEEE Research Paper folder**, users can find the research paper.



- In the files of **Vanilla GANs, C-GANs, DC-GANs and WAN**, users can find all the coding Notebooks and each notebook files is named according to the specific GAN combination it represents.



- For the **GANs-generated topographic images**, navigate to the "GANs - Generated Topographic Images" folder. Within this directory, you will find subfolders named after each specific GAN variant. For further information, check the tree map below.

└── Upscaling and Evaluating the topo below 100.ipynb
    └── Focused on upscaling images and evaluating topographies with dimensions under 100.


In the **Preprocessed for FID Score** folder, users will find images that have been cropped to their specific sizes in line with the requirements for calculating the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) Score. Each folder within is named to correspond with the specific GAN combination used in the coding notebooks.
