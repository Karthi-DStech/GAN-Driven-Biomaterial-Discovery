<h2>Welcome to [AI-based Advancements for Biomaterial Discovery: Comparative Analysis of GAN Models in Topography Generation]</h2>

<h3>Thank you for visiting the repository of [GANs-for-BIO-MATERIAL-DISCOVERY]! This project is dedicated to exploring the innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Bio-Material Discovery.</h3>

<h3>This Repository includes detailed documentation, source code, and results from our research.</h3>


**IN THIS READ ME FILE, USERS CAN FIND STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS AND FEEL FREE TO EXPLORE.**

- In the **IEEE Research Paper GANs folder**, users can find the research paper. 



- In the files of **Vanilla GANs, C-GANs, DC-GANs and WAN**, users can find all the coding Notebooks and each notebook files is named according to the specific GAN combination it represents.



- For the **GANs-generated topographic images**, navigate to the "GANs - Generated Topographic Images" folder. Within this directory, you will find subfolders named after each specific GAN variant. For further information, check the tree map below.

- In the **Preprocessed for FID Score** folder, users will find images that have been cropped to their specific sizes in line with the requirements for calculating the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) Score. Each folder within is named to correspond with the specific GAN combination used in the coding notebooks.



**INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACTIVATING TENSORBOARD**

- Guidelines for utilizing TensorBoard on a laptop or HPC are as follows:
- Ensure TensorBoard is installed.
- The summary writer will generate a directory named 'logs' or 'runs' within the same location as the notebook.
- Navigate to the directory containing the TensorBoard logs using the Command Line Interface (CLI), for example, cd [path_to_directory].
- Execute the following command, modifying it to match the name of your generated summary file.

tensorboard --logdir=runs

- A link will be displayed in the command-line interface. Click on it to open the tensorboard in your browser or copy and paste the link.
- If you are using Google Colab, Just run the notebook and the tensorboard will be activated automatically. 


**Other Instructions**

- Ensure you have all the required libraries installed before running the notebooks.
- Modify parameters and paths as needed to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
- Make sure all the notebooks and the data folder are in same Directory.
- Each dataset is zipped for compact storage and needs to be uncompressed before use.
