<h2>Welcome to [AI-based Advancements for Biomaterial Discovery: Comparative Analysis of GAN Models in Topography Generation]</h2>

<h3>Thank you for visiting the repository of [GANs-for-BIO-MATERIAL-DISCOVERY]! This project is dedicated to exploring the innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Bio-Material Discovery.</h3>

<h3>This Repository includes detailed documentation, source code, and results from our research.</h3>


**IN THIS READ ME FILE, USERS CAN FIND STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS AND FEEL FREE TO EXPLORE.**

- In the **IEEE Research Paper folder**, users can find the research paper.



- In the files of **Vanilla GANs, C-GANs, DC-GANs and WAN**, users can find all the coding Notebooks and each notebook files is named according to the specific GAN combination it represents.



- For the **GANs-generated topographic images**, navigate to the "GANs - Generated Topographic Images" folder. Within this directory, you will find subfolders named after each specific GAN variant. For further information, check the tree map below.

- In the **Preprocessed for FID Score** folder, users will find images that have been cropped to their specific sizes in line with the requirements for calculating the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) Score. Each folder within is named to correspond with the specific GAN combination used in the coding notebooks.



**INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACTIVATING TENSORBOARD**

- The Instructions for Tensor board when using in Laptop or HPC are given below
- Install Tensor board if doesn't.
- The summary writer will create the summary called logs or runs in the same directory of the notebook.
- Go to the same directory using Command Line Interface (for eg- cd [directory location fo the file].
- Run the below command and alter the command according to the created summary file.

tensorboard --logdir=runs

- A link will be shown in the CLI. Click that and tensor board will be popped up in the browser.


**Other Instructions**

- Ensure you have all the required libraries installed before running the notebooks.
- Modify parameters and paths as needed to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
- Make sure all the notebooks and the data folder are in same Directory.
- Each dataset is zipped for compact storage and needs to be uncompressed before use.
